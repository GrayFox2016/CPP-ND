htop author here. These are the calculations I make to get the numbers for the green, blue and yellow bars in the memory meter:

Total used memory = MemTotal - MemFree
Non cache/buffer memory (green) = Total used memory - (Buffers + Cached memory)
Buffers (blue) = Buffers
Cached memory (yellow) = Cached + SReclaimable - Shmem
Swap = SwapTotal - SwapFree
